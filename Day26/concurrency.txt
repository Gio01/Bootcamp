Concurrency allows us to be able to run multiple tasks at the same time (parallel)

We use threads to be able to handle multiple tasks at the same time where a thread 
is able to take on a single task/program to do/run

The threads are then given to the processor for that single processor to execute 
some program/task! Now given that there is a single processor and it can only process
one program at a time what will happen when we have multiple threads running? Well
what happens is that the other threads will be hanging until the processor finishes 
running that other thread and then the processor will then run the next thread!
