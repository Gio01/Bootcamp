there is an issue with single page applications such as that of using Angular, the problem
is that now we lose the ability to use Url Routing such as
www.amazon.com/products/phones/iphone

We cannot do this in Angular as it is a single page application! To do the same 
we need to do:

go to amazon.com
click on products
click on phones
click on iphone

So this is an issue with using something like Angular! So what is a way in which we 
can fix this?
