bank account assignment
-------------------

user should be able to make
- deposits
- withdrawal

we need to store this data in a csv file 


Think about this as a single account and the file will contain for
data from only a single account

In the file we should store all the transaction history and then
we should be able to get the transactions and then use that to 
calculate the current balance!


each row should be a transaction
columns will be the names such as 
- Type: deposit or withdrawal
- Date: for when the transaction was made
- Account name: to know from what acc the transactions are from


Bank Account Interface Menu:
1. Withdraw
2. Deposit
3. Check Balance
4. Exit
(we can have an option to save or we can automatically store it upon
each request for either a withdrawal or deposit!)

Ensure to delegate the responsibilities to each module accordingly such as
the storage functionality should be within its own module!
