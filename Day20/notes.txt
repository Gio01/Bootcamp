Python?
    - this is an interpreted Language
    - loosely typed 

Data Types
    Integers
    Strings -> these are immutable so we cannot directly try to change them! 
    
you can find the type of the variable by using
    - type(var)


first_name = 'Gio'
last_name = 'Ordonez'

full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name //'Gio Ordonez'
full_name[0] //'G'

len(full_name) //11
full_name[0] = 'a' //TypeError! Str object does not support item assignment!! Strings are immutable so we cannot
                    //change the values of the created Strings

String slicing! 
full_name[0:3] //'Gio' cells 0 to 2 the end is not exclusive! 
full_name[-1] //'z'
full_name[-5:-1]//'onez' (this is going backwards so we need to flip thepositions for the -5 
                //and the -1! Rather weird so really think about it because full_name[-1:-5]
                //will give you an empty string! )

full_name[5:len(full_name)]// 'rdonez'
full_name[:5] //'Gio O'


str_with_spaces = '        This is a string with spaces       '
str_with_spaces.lstrip() //'This is a string with spaces       '
str_with_spaces.rstrip() //'        This is a string with spaces'
str_with_spaces.strip() //'This is a string with spaces'

full_name.startswith('G')//True
full_name.endswith('z') //True


input() //this function is used to get user input! you can also store this into a var s = input()
input('Enter your name') //this message will be prompted to the user before they input something


'Python' + 2 //Error! cannot concatenate str and an interpreted
'python' * 2 //'pythonpython'
