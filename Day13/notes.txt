Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Operation

Synchronous
    An operation that is initiated and waited for until it completes

Asynchronous
    An operation that is initiated but NOT waited for until it completes

Now in JS there is not a manner in which we can use threading so that 
we can perform Asynchronous functions/operations! Meaning that we need to 
simulate this use of threading for different operations in JS!

- We can use callbacks to basically have that function print out the values
once some calculations have been done! 
    1. do some calculations -> put it in a var -> pass that var into a callbacks

- Now there are delagation issues with callbacks! Meaning that not other functions
are able to use these callbacks! Only the single method that contains that callback
is able to use this ! 1 to 1! But what if we want other functions to be able to 
call that callback aswell!? 

- We can use the promise API in order to create an object by which we can use
to delegate(generically) to other functions to be able to return things 
Asynchronous to multiple requesters/functions!
