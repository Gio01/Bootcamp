  Here we have the app-root, now this is the same as we did with the jquery

  var view = new SalaryCalculator(model)
  view.render().$root.appendTo(document.body)
  where the root was defined as a single target div where we would render out
  html code! 

   $root = $('<div></div>');//The instance view!
