<h3>Pipes</h3>
<h4>Currency</h4>
<div>{{100 | currency:'EUR'}}</div>
<!-- Here we are using the CurrencyPipe in Angular API, so angular
will automatically read this: {{100 | currency}} and convert this 
to $100.00 for us unless if we give it some more specifications
for how we want to customize the data displayed!

ex: {{100 | currency:'EUR'}} will display the 100 in eruos
-->
