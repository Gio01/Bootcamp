In order to do unit testing we should not be testing classes that have dependencies
on other classes with that dependency but rather we need to create a mock 
class to act as that dependency so that we can isolate that one class on its own 
as when we do unit testing we need to isolate all tests/class, etc.. so that 
we can trully see if the error is within one class or in some other area! otherwise
we will have a hard time being able to see where exactly is that error!!

If we were to have used that dependency then that is integration testsing and not unit 
testing!

Unit testing requires us to test each unit in ISOLATION without any dependencies!!
