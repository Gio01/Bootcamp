                However here within teh calculcate() we are not making a 
                public change and is only private which means that the view
                does not have any idea of the logic within the calculate 
                method!!  meaning that a change we make here will not require
                a change in the view unlike with the public change of adding the
                public educationCess variable did as we then needed to add 
                another change() call to get that user data into the model!
                */
            }
        }

        /*
            The reason in now creating a class is so that we now have seperation 
            in the calculator logic and that of the displaying of the data onto
            the UI. In this manner we seperate the responsabilities of the calc 
            and the UI! 

            This will help us to be able to better maintain the application in the
            long run as we now know that if we need to make a change to the calc
            functionality then we need to go to the class and not look into the UI
            in the JQuery area and then if we need to change something within the
            UI and how data is displayed then we will go into the JQuery area
            in order to then make the changes we want for the UI of the application

            However even now we still have some issues! What else do we need to 
            change now to make this ready for deployment?
            - We have an issue of tight coupling where If I make some change within the
            Calc class such as addnig a new variable state, then uppon creating it 
            and then using it in the calculate function, we will then need to go to the
            UI Jquery to also be able to get the user to supply data to that new 
            variable! In this manner it means that calculate relies on the data given 
            by the JQuery UI. 
                > Now how can we remove this dependancy (tight coupling) between the
                Model calculate() and that of the data from the UI in the case where
                we add a new variale or make changes within the class 


            So instead we will use change() instead of click() so that we do not need
            to wait until the user inputs all the data and clicks on the button 
            but rather we can simply get data from the user from when ever they 
            give it and hence becomes available!

        $(function(){

                model.hra = parseInt($(this).val()); 
            });

                In this manner we now are able to pass information from the user
                to the model without the user needing to input all of the data!

                This is called 
            */

            $('#btnCalculate').click(function () {
                //get the data from the controls

                model.calculate();
                /*
                Now here note that we need to call the calculate method before
                wanting to display any data in the ui! Otherwise it will not work
                correctly! This again is a dependence! 
                
                The view relies on calling the calculate method to get the salary 
                which means that it knows about the intenal method of the model! 
                In this manner we are still doing tight coupling!! 

                So how can we make this to be loosely coupled?
                - we need a manner by which the model can tell the view that the
                salary has been changes and only needs to display the salary!

                At the moment the view has knowledge of the model as we are doing
                window['model'] = new SalaryCalculatorModel();
                and also calling the model fields to get the data to display!

                We need a means by which the model can then have knowledge of the
                view as well so that the model can tell the view of when the 
                salary value is changing!
